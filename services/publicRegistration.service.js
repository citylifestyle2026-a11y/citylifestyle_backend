// services/publicRegistration.service.js
//
// Public, no-login counterpart to bookingTicket.service.js's registerUser.
// Everything here is reached only through a signed registration token (see
// utils/generateRegistrationToken.js / utils/verifyRegistrationToken.js) —
// there is no admin/staff auth on this flow, so the token IS the identity
// check. bookingTicket.service.js and its protected route/controller are
// untouched; this file does not import from or alter them.
//
// ================= MULTI-QUANTITY REGISTRATION =================
// A booking with quantity > 1 has multiple BookingTicket documents under
// the same bookingId, but only ONE registration token/link is ever issued
// (see routes/comment: "Do NOT change token/JWT or Public Registration
// URL"). So the token no longer identifies "the one ticket" — it
// identifies the BOOKING, via whichever ticket it was originally signed
// for (the "anchor" ticket). Every read/write below resolves the token to
// that anchor ticket's bookingId, then operates on the full set of
// sibling tickets under that booking. The token payload/verification
// itself is unchanged.
//
// Registration is always applied to the earliest still-unregistered
// sibling ticket (stable creation order via `_id`), never to a ticket
// chosen by the client. `data`/`file` still never carry or override which
// ticket gets updated — this preserves the original "token is the sole
// identity" guarantee while extending it to a set of tickets instead of
// one, and makes it impossible to double-register the same slot on a
// refresh/replay: once a ticket's isRegistered flips to true it drops out
// of the "earliest unregistered" query for good.
